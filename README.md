# Javascript-Guide-and-The-Mysterious-Code

- I will try to cover many topics for new developers for this amazing language that manipulates the web called javascript.
- Simple as possible, so even younger guys understand it.
- Also it will contain explanation for some mysterious stuff javascript has, which even more experienced programmers might struggle.
- Finally it will contain interview questions and answers that are sometimes confusing.
- When finished we will try to make a cool app or game or something like that!(Still thinking what to make!)
