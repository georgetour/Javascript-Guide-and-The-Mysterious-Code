            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
            <p>Javascript is the programming language of the web. When we had the first internet pages,
            everything was simple with some text inside it and some very basic styling.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, world wide web has evolved tremendously and users interact with pages in many
                ways. A pop up window, menus changing, image sliders and anything that you see in modern
                pages that increases their experience.

            </p>
            <p>Here is where javascript comes. Thanks to javascript you can manipulate the page with many amazing ways.</p>

            <h2>Do you need javascript?</h2>
            <p>Yes, yes and yes. If you are serious about web developing then javascript is a must.</p>
            <p>HTML5 and CSS3 are really powerful, but for anything web related to shine you must have javascript.</p>
            <p>When you have your first application or website that does something thanks to javascript, you will say WOW!  </p>

            <h2>What you need to start?</h2>
            <p>Some basic HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>A text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.1.html">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and a browser nothing more. So strong javascript is.</p>
            <p>After time passes though and you start to feel comfortable with the language you should use an IDE like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Webstorm</a>.</p>
            <p>Also you can use <a href="https://jsbin.com/?html,output">jsbin</a>or<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"> jsfiddle</a> which are nice tools for showing to others your code. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Let's start! Your first Hello world with javascript!</h2>
            <p>Create an html page and add these lines at head tag:</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script>
    alert("Hello world");
</script>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>This is an inline script and you can insert it anywhere in our HTML.
                Though inline scripting is not recommended.
            </p>
            <p>You should use external scripts.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>External scripts</h2>
            <p>As the word says these are scripts we call from outside our HTML page.</p>
