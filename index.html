        <!--Prologue-->
        <section>
            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
            <p>Javascript is the programming language of the web. When we had the first internet pages,
            everything was simple with some text inside it and some very basic styling.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, world wide web has evolved tremendously and users interact with pages in many
                ways. A pop up window, menus changing, image sliders and anything that you see in modern
                pages that increases their experience.

            </p>
            <p>Here is where javascript comes. Thanks to javascript you can manipulate the page with many amazing ways.</p>

            <h2>Do you need javascript?</h2>
            <p>Yes, yes and yes. If you are serious about web developing then javascript is a must.</p>
            <p>HTML5 and CSS3 are really powerful, but for anything web related to shine you must have javascript.</p>
            <p>When you have your first application or website that does something thanks to javascript, you will say WOW!  </p>

        <!--What you need to start-->
        <section>
            <h2>What you need to start?</h2>
            <p>Some basic HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>A text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.1.html">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and a browser nothing more. So strong javascript is.</p>
            <p>After time passes though and you start to feel comfortable with the language you should use an IDE like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Webstorm</a>.</p>
            <p>Also you can use <a href="https://jsbin.com/?html,output">jsbin</a>or<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"> jsfiddle</a> which are nice tools for showing to others your code. </p>

        <!--First hello world with javascript-->
        <section>
            <h2>Let's start! Your first Hello world with javascript!</h2>
            <p>Create an html page and add these lines at head tag:</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script>
    alert("Hello world");
</script>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>This is an inline script and you can insert it anywhere in our HTML.
                Though inline scripting is not recommended.
            </p>
            <p>You should use external scripts.</p>

        <!--External scripts-->
        <section>
            <h2>External scripts</h2>
            <p>As the word says these are scripts we call from outside our HTML page.</p>
            <p>Create a folder in your project called js. Then create a file called main.js</p>
            <p>At main.js write</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
alert("Hello world");
</textarea></code></pre>

            <p>Now we should call it!</p>
            <h4>4 ways to call it :</h4>

            <!--First way -->
            <h5>First not recommended to add these lines at head tag.</h5>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script src="js/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</textarea></code></pre>


        <p>So we are saying to our HTML to use an external script since we have the src attribute at js/main.js which is of type text/javascript.</p>
        <p>Reload the page to see that we will get our alert.</p>
        <p class="alert">This way is not recommended since imagine that page starts to run the code from top to bottom.
        When it finds this script the page will stop to load this script and then continue. That' s bad user experience, search engines don't like your page to be slow
            and you will see that speed measurements tools penalize you for that like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">google pagespeed insights</a>
            or <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">gtmetrix</a>.
        </p>
            <p>You can use it only if something really important must be loaded at beginning, because if it doesn't, the site or app
            doesn't seems nice at first view.
            </p>
          <!--End First way -->


        <!--Second way -->
        <h5>Second way old school but correct and no browser problems.</h5>
            <p>Just put the external script code at the end of the body.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script src="js/main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
&lt;/body>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>It will load the script when everything have finished so no problems with that. If you have many scripts just put them
            below and they will run from top to bottom.
            </p>

            <h5>Second way old school but correct and no browser problems.</h5>
