            <h1>Javascript Guide and The Mysterious Code.</h1>
            <p>A guide to javascript that will help you learn javascript and some mysterious code
            it hides that newcomers find it confusing. I will try to explain as simple as possible for beginners or even for those need a refreshing.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, you will see interview questions/answers, multiple choice and exercises. Maybe at the end we will built an app also.</p>

        <!--Prologue-->
        <section>
            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
            <p>Javascript is the programming language of the web. When we had the first internet pages,
            everything was simple with some text inside it and some very basic styling.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, world wide web has evolved tremendously and users interact with pages in many
                ways. A pop up window, menus changing, image sliders and anything that you see in modern
                pages that increases their experience.

            </p>
            <p>Here is where javascript comes. Thanks to javascript you can manipulate the page with many amazing ways.</p>

            <h2>Do you need javascript?</h2>
            <p>Yes, yes and yes. If you are serious about web developing and not only then javascript is a must.</p>
            <p>HTML5 and CSS3 are really powerful, but for anything web related to shine you must have javascript.</p>
            <p>When you have your first application or website that does something thanks to javascript, you will say WOW!  </p>

        <!--What you need to start-->
        <section>
            <h2>What you need to start?</h2>
            <p>Some basic HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>A text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.1.html">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and a browser nothing more. So strong javascript is.</p>
            <p>After time passes though and you start to feel comfortable with the language you should use an IDE like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Webstorm</a>.</p>
            <p>Also you can use <a href="https://jsbin.com/?html,output">jsbin</a> or<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"> jsfiddle</a> which are nice tools for showing to others your code. </p>

        <!--First hello world with javascript-->
        <section>
            <h2>Let's start! Your first Hello world with javascript!</h2>
            <p>Create an html page and add these lines at head tag:</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">&lt;script>
    alert("Hello world");
&lt;/script>
</code></pre>
            <p>This is an inline script and you can insert it anywhere in our HTML.
                Though inline scripting is not recommended.
            </p>
            <p>You should use external scripts.</p>

        </section><!--End First hello world with javascript-->

        <!--External scripts-->
        <section>
            <h2>External scripts</h2>
            <p>As the word says these are scripts we call from outside our HTML page. It's best to use external scripts since your code will become bigger
            and you maintain them more easily.
            </p>
            <p>Create a folder in your project called js. Then create a file called main.js</p>
            <p>At main.js write</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">alert("Hello world");
</code></pre>

            <p>Now we should call it!</p>
            <h3>4 ways to call it :</h3>

            <!--First way -->
            <h4>First not recommended to add these lines at head tag.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;script src="js/main.js" >&lt;/script>
</code></pre>


        <p>So we are saying to our HTML to use an external script since we have the src attribute at js/main.js which is of type text/javascript.</p>
        <p>Reload the page to see that we will get our alert.</p>
        <p ><span class="alert">This way is not recommended, unless a script must start that manipulates CSS,images etc.</span>Imagine that page starts to run the code from top to bottom.
        When it finds this script the page will stop to load this script and then continue. That' s bad user experience, search engines don't like your page to be slow
            and you will see that speed measurements tools penalize you for that like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">google pagespeed insights</a>
            or <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">gtmetrix</a>.
        </p>
          <!--End First way -->


        <!--Second way -->
        <h4>Second way old school but correct and no browser problems.</h4>
        <p>Just put the external script code at the end of the body.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;script src="js/main.js" >&lt/script>
&lt;/body>
</code></pre>
            <p>It will load the script when everything have finished so no problems with that. If you have many scripts just put them
            below and they will run from top to bottom.
            </p>

        <!--Third way-->
            <h4>Third way async attribute.</h4>
            <p>Just put the external script code at the head of the body with async attribute.</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;script async src="js/main.js" >&lt;/script>
</code></pre>
            <p>This is a good way that doesn't stop page loading. It loads the script asynchronous with the page. Though you might see some strange
                behaviors if you have many scripts that are depended each other.
            </p>
            <!--End Third way way -->

            <!--Forth way-->
            <h4>Forth way defer attribute.</h4>
            <p>Just put the external script code at the head of the body with defer attribute.</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;script defer src="js/main.js" >&lt;/script>
&lt;script defer src="js/main2.js" >&lt;/script>
</code></pre>
            <p>This is a recommended way to load the script since it won't stop the page from loading. It loads the script at the end in order.
                So we will have after the page load main.js and then main2.js.
            </p>
            <!--End forth way -->

        <!--Comment section-->
        <section><h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>Comments are very important for every language. I even put comments in my html code. When your projects become bigger
                and bigger you and others that use your code will get lost, if you don't have good commenting.
            </p>
            <p> I remember a professor I had that was very very strict about that. <strong>
                Always use comments, comments, comments.
            </strong>
            </p>
            <p>We have multi line commenting and single line commenting in javascript like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//I am single line comment
/*Multi line comments
    I love coding
    Do you? */
</code></pre>

            <p>Also we use them, so something doesn't get executed to see how our program behaves or just we don't want that to run for now.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//alert("Hello world");
</code></pre>
            <p>As you can see nothing happens now that the code is commented. </p>

        <!--Statements and semicolons section-->
        <section><h2>Statements and semicolons</h2>
            <p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are "instructions" to be "executed" by the web browser.
            </p>
            <p>For example the line we wrote was a statement: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">alert("Hello world");
</code></pre>

            <p>Also you might noticed semicolons at the end and it's common usage in many programming languages. Semicolons are used to separate our statements.</p>

        </section><!--Statements and semicolons section-->

        <!--Variables section-->
        <section><h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are very important. You store something into a variable so you can easily call it or make changes.
            </p>
            <p>Let's see how we declare a variable in javascript by simpling adding the keyword var. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Declaring variables
var  shippingUK;
var  shippingEurope;
</code></pre>
            <p>Also we can declare them with comma between the variables names which is the same :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Declaring variables
var  shippingUK, shippingEurope;
</code></pre>

            <p>Ok now to alert this variable value simple :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Alerting the variable's shippingUK value returns undefined
alert(shippingUK);
</code></pre>
            <p>You will notice now it alerts undefined. Makes sense since our shippingUK variable doesn't have any values and it says to us :</p>
               <p><strong>"Hey man I don't have anything stored in me what I'm supposed to show?"</strong></p>

            <p>But what if you had 100 products and the shipping price changed ? You would have to change every product shipping price</p>
            <p>With variables you simply change one value. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Giving variables values
var  shippingUK = 20 ;
var  shippingEurope = 50;
</code></pre>
            <p>Now see that we will get from alert message the value as supposed to :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Alerting the variable's shippingUK value
alert(shippingUK);
</code></pre>


            <h5>Side notes for variables:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Variables must start with letters only.</li>
                <li>You can' t use as name keywords like var, function etc...</li>
                <li>Javascript is case sensitive so var HELLO  is different than var hello.</li>
                <li>You can't use spaces for naming.</li>
                <li>Also it is used in programming to use camel case practice so you understand we have different word after.</li>

            </ol>

    <!--Data types-->
    <section>
    <h2>Data types</h2>
    <p>In javascript you don't have to give a type to a variable since it does it automatically.</p>
     <ol>

                <!--Number-->
                <li><h3>Number</h3>
                <p>Javascript has only one kind of number. Numbers can be written with, or without, decimals </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Some number variables
var  shippingUK = 20 ;
var  shoePrice = 50;
var  tax =  1.23//Which equals +23% ;
var  totalPrice = ( shoePrice * tax) + shippingUK;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Alerting the variable's totalPrice value
alert(totalPrice);
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <!--String-->
                <li><h3>String</h3>
                <p>You can use single or double quotes to declare a string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//String
var  myName = "George";
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Alerting myName
alert (myName);//Will alert George
</code></pre>
                <p>It's the same with :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var  myName = 'George';
</code></pre>
                <p>But don't get confused if you declare it like this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var  myName = George;
</code></pre>
                <p>It will declare the var myName equal to the variable George which we don't have.</p>
                </li><!--String-->


                <!--Boolean-->
                <li><h3>Boolean</h3>
                <p>Boolean is a type that returns true or false. Imagine it like yes/no or a switch on/off.</p>
                <p>Booleans are often used in conditional testing which we will see later.</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = true;
var y = false;
</code></pre>
                </li><!--Boolean-->

                <!--Arrays-->
                <li><h3>Arrays</h3>
                    <p>Very important for all programming languages. <a>Covered here</a></p>
                </li>

                <!--Object-->
                <li><h3>Object</h3>
                <p>In javascript almost everything is an object. <a>Full details here</a></p>
                </li>

                <!--Null-->
                <li><h3>Null</h3>
                <p>We can give a variable the value of null. It means it's null,nothing,empty but null also is an object in javascript.</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = null;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">alert (x); //Will alert null</code></pre>
                </li><!--Null-->

     </ol><!--End ordered list types of variables-->

            <!--Undefined vs null-->
            <h2>Undefined vs Null</h2>
            <h3 class="mysteriousCode">Mysterious Code(interview question)</h3>
            <p>So a lot of people confuse those two meanings in javascript.</p>

            <h4>Undefined</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x; //undefined</code></pre>
            <p>As we see we don't give a value to x that means undefined . We haven't defined any values to x.</p>

            <h4>Null</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = null;</code></pre>
            <p>That's not undefined since it has value which that value is null. It means "nothing".</p>

            <h3>Let's start using our console before continuing</h3>
            <p>All non mobile browsers have built in developer tools. Just open their options/settings and find something like Developer tools.</p>
            <p>There find a tab that says Console. It's very important to learn to use developer tools since it will also help you

        <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
        <ol>

            <li><h4>Addition</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 5;
var result = x + y; //result is 15
</code></pre>

            <li><h4>Multiplication</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 5;
var result = x * y; //result is 50
</code></pre>

            <li><h4>Division</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 5;
var result = x / y; //result is 2
</code></pre>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Modulus</h4>
            <p>This is a confusing operator that returns the remainder of the division.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 5;
var result = x % y; //result is 0
</code></pre>

           <p>But if we have this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 11;
var y = 5;
var result = x % y; //result is 1 because dividing 11 / 5 gives 2 and remainder is 1
</code></pre>

            </li>

            <li><h4>Incrementing and Decrementing</h4>
                <p>Increment operator increases the value by 1 and decrement decreases it by 1.
                    Very useful for loops when we reach there.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
//Post Increment operator by adding ++
x++ ; //Now the x is 11. It's like saying x = x + 1

var y = 5;

y-- ; //Now the y is 4. It's like saying y = y - 1

        <h3>Assignment Operators</h3>
        <p>The most common we saw is the = .Remember they assign a value. We also have :</p>
        <table>

             <tr>
                <td>Operator</td>

                 <td>x /= y</td>
                 <td>x = x / y</td>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 5;
var y = 10;

</code></pre>
        <p>So every assignment operator works like that. Think of it like a shortcut.</p>

            <h3>Comparison operators</h3>
            <p>As the word says you compare two things not assign values to them like we had above.</p>
            <ol>

            <li>
            <h4>Equality Operator</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 5;
var y = 10;
console.log(x==y);
</code></pre>
            <p>Returns false since x is not equal with y. <strong>Notice the == and not = since we are comparing NOT assigning a value.</strong></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Identity Operator</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 5;
var y = 10;
console.log(x===y);
</code></pre>
                <p>Again it returns false.</p>
                <p>But here we have === which they also compare <strong>the type except the value</strong>. Most people suggest to use this
                as safer way.
                </p>
            </li>
                <li><h4>Not equal</h4>
                    <p>In javascript if we put a ! it means NOT.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 5;
var y = 10;
console.log(x!=y);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Returns true since we are saying x is NOT equal y.</p>
                    <p>You will find it very useful along your career.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Not equal value or type</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 10;
console.log(x!==y);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Returns false since they are equal and same type.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Greater than and less than</h4>
                    <p>Like maths we have the > and < symbols .</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 8;
console.log(x > y);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Returns true since x is greater than y.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Greater than or equal and less than or equal operators</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 8;
console.log(x >= y);
console.log(x <= y);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Returns true at first line false at second line.</p>

                <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
                <p>Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>&&</h4>
                        <p>This operator is like saying and. It means that two conditions must be met.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 8;
var k = 7 ;
console.log(x >= y && k < y);
</code></pre>
                        <p>It returns true since x is greater or equal than y and at the same time k is less than y.</p>

                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <h4>||</h4>
                        <p>This operator means or. One or the other condition must be met.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 8;
var k = 7 ;
console.log(x >= y || k > y);
</code></pre>
                        <p>It returns true since x is greater or equal than y and that's enough.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>!</h4>
                        <p>We saw it again at comparison operators which means NOT.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 8;
console.log( !(x > y) );
</code></pre>

                        <p>Returns false since it says that NOT(x > y). We see though and know that x is greater than y.</p>
                        <p>Notice the parenthesis because we want the ! operator only for (x > y) and if we had more variables we will have wrong results. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
            <p>These statements are very important in every programming language and if you understand the general idea here
            you will be able to use them in any language since only some syntax changes will occur.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                <h3>If statement</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Variables
var x = 10;
var y = 8;
//If statement
if(x > y){
    console.log("Yes x is greater than y");
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Pretty simple right? We start with if. Then inside the parenthesis we put the condition we want to meet.
                    Finally between the curly brushes we say what we will do if the condition is met.
                    </p>
                    <p ><span class="alert-info">HINT : Remember always  open and close curly brushes and then put the code in it.

                <li>
                    <h3>Switch</h3>
                    <p>Switch is very powerful conditional statement that replaces having code with multiple if.</p>
                    <p>Though in the beginning it might seem confusing if you get used to it you will love it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Variable
var myName = "George";

//Switch
switch(myName){

    case "George":
        console.log("Your name is George");
        break;
    case "John" :
        console.log("Your name is John");
        break;
    case "Alex" :
        console.log("Your name is Alex");
        break;
    default :
        console.log("I don't know your name");
}//End switch
</code></pre>
                    <p>So we declared var myName = "George". Then we put into the parenthesis th variables name that we will
                    need to check. We open and close curly braces and we say case "George" : do something. We finish this condition
                      if it's the correct by adding break;.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end as you can see we add the default keyword and then what to do. With default we are saying what we want to do
                    if no case matches.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's see how to do it with if. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Variable
var myName = "George";

if(myName==="George"){
    console.log("Your name is George");
}
else if(myName==="John"){
    console.log("Your name is John");
}
else if(myName==="Alex"){
    console.log("Your name is Alex");
}
else{
    console.log("I don't know your name");
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Imagine having many many conditions how many ifs you would have to put.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes you want different switch cases to use same code. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Variable
var number = 1;

//Switch
switch(number){

    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
        console.log("We have a number smaller than 4");
        break;
    case 4 :
        console.log("The number is 4");
        break;
    case 5 :
    case 6 :
        console.log("We have a number bigger than 4");
        break;
    default :
        console.log("I don't know this number");
}//End switch
</code></pre>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Conditional (Ternary) Operator</h3>
                    <p>Conditional ternary operator is another shortcut for if statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var x = 5;
var y = 6;

//After the condition a question mark then if true the left code : else right code
(x < y)? console.log("x is smaller than y"): console.log("x is not smaller than y");

</code></pre>
                    <p>It has strange syntax but look what we are saying. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Same result as above
if(x < y){
    console.log("x is smaller than y");

    console.log("x is not smaller than y")

        <!--Functions-->
        <section>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>A function is a block of code that we can call it by name if we want.</p>
            <p>We do that so instead of writing again and again the code we just call/invoke the function.</p>
            <p>Some people say call a function some others invoke a function. It's what fits you.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Function declarations</h3>
                    <p>First we add the keyword function then name, parenthesis and the curly brackets.  </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Creating your first function
function hello(){
    console.log("Hello from function");
}
//To call/invoke a function you simply write it's name, parenthesis and we close the statement with semicolon
hello();
hello();
hello();
</code></pre>
                    <p>So instead of writing three times the code we just called/invoked the function hello three times.
                        Pretty useful and fundamental .</p>
                    <p>Also we can have a function have parameters and return us a value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//A function with two parameters that will return the division of them
function divide(number1, number2){
    return number1 / number2;
}

console.log(divide(6,3));
console.log(divide(12,3));
</code></pre>
                    <p>At console log we will have the result of 2 and 3 below. We simply called function divide and gave it the parameters values.
                        <strong>The values we give are called arguments.</strong> </p>
                    <p>When you create a function you also create the arguments built in object
                    and you can see it's length or access a specific argument: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var division = function divide(number1, number2){
    //Will show us the length when we will give arguments
    console.log(arguments.length);

    //It will show us the 0 indexed argument which in current case is 1
    console.log(arguments[0]);

};

//First argument is 1 second argument is 2
division(1,2);

</code></pre>
                    <p>So a parameter is a local variable that's inside the function and the argument is the value of that.</p>
                    <p>As you can see this is amazing since we only change the arguments of the function to have new result.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Function expressions</h3>
                    <p>In javascript you can store a function expression in a variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//A function with two parameters that will return the division of them stored in var division
var division = function divide(number1, number2){
    return number1 / number2;
}

//You can't call/invoke it by the function name but only with the variable name like this
console.log(division(6,3));
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Anonymous function</h3>
                    <p>Also we can have an anonymous function in javascript like that :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//An anonymous function with two parameters that will return the division of them stored in var division
var division = function (number1, number2){
    return number1 / number2;
}

//And you call it like that
console.log(division(6,3));
</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Using functions as parameters</h3>
            <p>We can have functions as parameters in javascript.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//A function with first parameter a variable and second a function
function advanced(id, update){
    update();//if we don't call it it won't work
}
//New function called updateList
function updateList() {
    console.log("List updated");
}
//Now we call the function advanced, pass first argument 1 and second the function updateList
advanced(1 , updateList);
</code></pre>
        <h3>Return functions inside a function </h3>
        <p>Now things become a little complicated but you should know it so you can understand if you see it somewhere.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//A more advanced function that returns functions
var order = function(specialClient){

    if(specialClient === true){
        return function(name){
            console.log("Discount for " + name);
        };
    }
    else{
        return function (name) {
            console.log("Normal order for " + name);
        };
    }
};

//By calling the function like this nothing happens
order(true);

//Now we store it in a variable
var startOrdering = order(true);

//Calling the function
startOrdering(); // But we get undefined since the return has nothing in it

//And the correct way
startOrdering("George");

        <!--Objects-->
        <section>
            <h2>Objects</h2>
            <p>In javascript almost everything is an object. Objects are containers for storing variables and functions.</p>
            <p>An object's function is called a method. </p>
            <p>An object's variable is a property . </p>
            <p>Also remember that in functions/methods you have to use ().</p>
            <p><strong>To access an object's property you simply add to the object the dot as we were doing with console.log</strong></p>
            <h3>Let's use our first object :</h3>
            <p>Create a div in your page at body and give it an id :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="products">JS manipulation&lt/div&gt
</code></pre>
            <p>Then at our script we will use the object document and the method getElementById which we have in all browsers :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Storing the object document with the method getElementByID and id products
   var div = document.getElementById("products");
//Now let't use a property of div object
    div.innerHTML = "I changed thanks to javascript!";
</code></pre>
            <p>So we created an object that in document had id products. Then we used
            a property that's already created in all browsers innerHTML which means the html text.
            </p>
            <p>Find more methods and properties below :</p>
            <h4>
                <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp">Document object Properties and Methods</a>
            </h4>
            <h4><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp">HTML elements methods and properties</a></h4>

            <h3>Let's create our first object!</h3>
            <p>You name a variable, then open and close curly brushes. Inside of it name of property and with : value of property. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var client = {
    name : "George",
    lastName : "Tourtsinakis" ,
    job : "Full Stack Developer"
}

document.getElementById('products').innerHTML = client.name;
</code></pre>
            <p>Also we can access a property with this syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var client = {
    name : "George",
    lastName : "Tourtsinakis" ,
    job : "Full Stack Developer"
}

//Different syntax for accessing a property of an object
document.getElementById('products').innerHTML = client["name"];
</code></pre>
            <p>Now refresh and look your div with id products</p>
            <p>Also you can change the property value : </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
client.name = "John";
</code></pre>
            <p>Let 's create new methods and have a taste of <strong>this</strong> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var client = {
    name : "George",
    lastName : "Tourtsinakis" ,
    job : "Full Stack Developer",
    orders : 100,
    giveDiscount : function(){
        if(this.orders > 99){
           document.getElementById('products').innerHTML= "Discount 3%";
        }
        else{
           document.getElementById('products').innerHTML= "No discount";
        }
    }
};
//Calling the method giveDiscount from client object
client.giveDiscount();
</code></pre>
            <p>We have an object called client some properties and a method called giveDiscount. When we say this.orders we are saying with javascript
                the property orders which is in this object which in our current case is client. It's the same with :
            </p>
 <pre><code class="language-javascript">
var client = {
    name : "George",
    lastName : "Tourtsinakis" ,
    job : "Full Stack Developer",
    orders : 100,
    giveDiscount : function(){
        if(client.orders > 99){
           document.getElementById('products').innerHTML= "Discount 3%";
        }
        else{
            document.getElementById('products').innerHTML= "No discount";
        }
    }

};
//Calling the method giveDiscount from client object
client.giveDiscount();
</code></pre>


            <!--Object Constructor-->
            <h3>Object Constructor</h3>
            <p>We saw above how to create objects. We need more clients though correct?</p>
            <p>It would be bad writing :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var client = {
    name : "George",
    lastName : "Tourtsinakis" ,
    job : "Full Stack Developer"
}

var client2 = {
    name : "Elisabeth",
    lastName : "Of Egypt" ,
    job : "Queen"
}

var client3 = {
    name : "Leo",
    lastName : "Cool" ,
    job : "unknown"
}

</code></pre>

        <p>So much repeating code and what if you wanted to change a property or add new? You should change it to each object.</p>
        <p>But we have a solution for that and it's called a constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function client(name,lastName,job) {
    this.name = name ;
    this.lastName =lastName ;
    this.job = job ;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Remember we said that in javascript almost everything is an object? Well now we have an object called client.
            Though you will be confused and say "Why this.name"  equals with name?
            </p>
            <p>With this.name we are referring to the object client and equals name is the local variable we have as parameters.</p>
            <p>And to create a new client we simply use the new keyword and we pass the arguments we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Creating a new clients
var client1 = new client("George","Tourtsinakis","Full Stack Developer");
var client2 = new client("Elisabeth","Of Egypt","Queen");

document.getElementById('products').innerHTML = client1.name;//It will show George
</code></pre>

            <p>It was like writing :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function client(localVarName,localVarLastName,localVarJob) {
    this.name = localVarName ;
    this.lastName = localVarLastName ;
    this.job = localVarJob ;
}

</code></pre>
            <p>You see how this is used and what is referred to? For name convenience we give the property name the same as our local variables
            names. Amazing isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>Let's have a method from this object constructor :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function client(name,lastName,job,orders) {
    this.name = name ;
    this.lastName =lastName ;
    this.job = job ;
    this.orders = orders;
    this.giveDiscount = function(){
        if(this.orders > 99){
            document.getElementById('products').innerHTML= "Discount 3%";
        }
        else{
            document.getElementById('products').innerHTML= "No discount";
        }
    }
}

var client1 = new client("George","Tourtsis","Full Stack Developer",100);
client1.giveDiscount();

        <h3>Javascript Object protoypes</h3>
        <p>Every object in javascript has a prototype.</p>
        <p>Remember this code?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Storing the object document with the method getElementByID and id products
   var div = document.getElementById("products");
//Now let't use a property of div object
    div.innerHTML = "I changed thanks to javascript!";
</code></pre>
        <p>We created an object that already had some pre created properties like innerHTML.
        Without us doing anything div inherited everything(properties,methods)from its prototype.
        </p>
        <p><strong>This is called prototype inheritance.</strong></p>
        <p>All javascript objects inherit from their prototype.</p>
        <p>The top in chain is Object.prototype so all inherit from this.</p>
        <p>What if we want to add a new property in an object?</p>
        <p>We can add it directly to our constructor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function client(name,lastName,job,orders,address) {
    this.name = name ;
    this.lastName =lastName ;
    this.job = job ;
    this.orders = orders;
    this.address = address;
}
var client1 = new client();
</code></pre>
            <p>And we can add directly to client1 a new property but then only client1 will have it :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
client1.newProperty = 5 ;
</code></pre>
          <p>Many times we work with other teams,use frameworks,libraries etc which would be bad directly
          inserting into the function the new property or method. Also maybe you want to create a plugin
          for a library or framework.
          </p>
          <p>This is achieved by using the prototype property :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
client.prototype.newProperty = 5 ;
</code></pre>

        <!--Arrays-->
        <section>
            <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>Arrays are fundamentals and very very useful for all programming languages.</p>
            <p>Array is a special variable that can hold more than one value at a time.</p>
            <p>Imagine it like having a storage with products in it.</p>
            <p>Without using an array you would write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var product1 = "mobile-phones";
var product2 = "air-conditions";
var product3 = "tvs";

</code></pre>
            <p>Well if you have 2-3 products this will work but what if you add more products or you have more than 100-200?</p>
            <p>This is where arrays come in.</p>
            <p>You declare a var then equals  opening closing brackets: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = ["mobile-phones","air-conditions","tvs"];
</code></pre>
            <p>For better readability you can write it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs"
];
</code></pre>
            <p>Also we can create an array using the new keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = new Array("mobile-phones","air-conditions","tvs");
</code></pre>
        <p>Arrays in javascript are zero indexed so in position 0 we have mobile phones and
        you call it like that:
        </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log(products[0]);
</code></pre>
            <p>And for the whole array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log(products);
</code></pre>
            <p>To see how many elements an array has in it you just use the length property:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log(products.length);
</code></pre>
            <p>It returns 3 since we have mobile phones, air conditions and tvs.</p>
            <p>To add new element in our array we use the method push:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
products.push("books");
</code></pre>
            <p>It means pushing a new element at the end of the array.</p>
            <p><strong>Remember arrays are objects.</strong> </p>


            <p>Now let's create an unordered list with some items in our body html.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;ul id="mobilePhones">
    &lt;li>iphone&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>galaxy&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>xperia&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
</code></pre>
            <p>We can grab anything we want in our script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var mobilePhones = document.getElementById("mobilePhones").getElementsByTagName("li");

console.log(mobilePhones[0].innerHTML);
</code></pre>
            <p>So we grabbed something from out page that had the id of mobilePhones and at this
            id we needed from li tag the zero element.
            </p>
            <p>Pretty cool right?</p>
            <p>According to w3schools you should:</p>
            <p>Use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
               Use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.</p>

            <h3>Some useful array methods and properties</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><h4>Join</h4>
                    <p>The join method returns the string of the array and by default separates them by comma.
                        You can give the parameter value you want: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs"
];

//Our html
&ltdiv id="products">&lt/div>

//Showing the array to our html with join and &ltbr> tags
document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = products.join("<br>");

</code></pre>
                </li>

                <li><h4>Length</h4>
                    <p>The length property which can be used with an array or an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs"
];

//Our html
&ltdiv id="products">&lt/div>

//Showing the length array
document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = products.length;
</code></pre>
                <p>Will show 3 since we have 3 elements in our array.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>Concat</h4>
                <p>The concat method is used to join two or more arrays each other in one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs"
];

//Second array
var newProducts = [
    "books",
    "laptops"

];

//Concat the two arrays and show them in our HTML
document.getElementById("products").innerHTML= products.concat(newProducts).join("<br>");
</code></pre>
            <p>Now you will say WOW man stop it what you did here?</p>
            <p>In javascript this is called <strong>method chaining</strong>.
                We simply add multiple methods by what order we want them to be executed.</p>
                <p>So in our example in our document we got the content of id products.
                    Then we had the array products and we added(concat) the array newProducts to it and then
                    we separated with &ltbr> the new  array.
                </p>
                <p class="alert-warning">
                    Though we don't have the newly created array anywhere so we must store it somewhere:
                </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//New value for products that has the newProducts  also

//Remove element at the start of the array

</code></pre>
                    <p>We will have 2 items without mobile-phones</p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>Unshift</h4>
                    <p>This will add at the start of the array an element.</p>

                    <p>Our first element will be books now.</p>
                </li>


                <li><h4>Sort</h4>
                    <p>By default,
                        the sort() method sorts the values as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
                    </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",

];

//Alphabetical and ascending order
products.sort();

document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = products;
</code></pre>
                    <p>We will have air-conditions,mobile-phones,tvs. Awesome!</p>
                    <p class="alert-warning">But if we want to return numbers from the smaller to the bigger  it won't work like that.</p>
                    <p>We need to add a function in our method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array with numbers
var clientId = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    31
];

//With this function we will show them in correct order
products.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});
</code></pre>

                    <p>Now from bigger to smaller:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array with numbers
var clientId = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    31
];

//With this function we will show them in correct order
products.sort(function(a, b){return b-a});
</code></pre>
                    <p>We will have 31,4,3,2,1</p>

                </li>

                <li><h4>Reverse</h4>
                    <p>The opposite of sort since it reverses the array in descending order!</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs"
];

//Reverse in descending order
products.reverse();

document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = products;
</code></pre>
                    <p>We will have tvs,air-conditions,mobile-phones</p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>Slice</h4>
                    <p>This method returns the elements we want only from what index how many to show: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs",
    "books",
    "laptops"
];

var sliced = products.slice(0,2)

document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = sliced;
</code></pre>
                    <p class="alert-warning">It doesn't include the last element we put so it will show
                        mobile-phones,air-conditions.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Splice</h4>
                    <p>The splice method adds/removes elements to an array and returns the removed. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs",
    "books",
    "laptops"
];
//First argument which place to start removing, second argument how many to remove from that position and so on
    products.splice(1,2)

document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = products;
</code></pre>
                    <p>So the result will be air-conditions,tvs.</p>
                    <p>We can add to the removed something new like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs",
    "books",
    "laptops"
];
//First argument which place to start removing second argument how many to remove from that position and so on
products.splice(1,2,"monitors","drones");

document.getElementById("products").innerHTML = products;
</code></pre>
                    <p>We will have mobile-phones,monitors,drones,books,laptops since we said at
                    index 1 remove 2 and add monitors,drones and then continue the array.</p>
                </li>


            </ol>

        <!--Loops-->
        <section>
            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <p>A loop is something that executes continuously while a condition is true. </p>
            <p>Loops are very useful in all programming world and fundamental.</p>
            <p>Our array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array
var product = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs",
    "books",
    "laptops"
];
</code></pre>
            <p>Let's store our documents id to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Store id to variable
var products = document.getElementById("products");
</code></pre>
            <p>Show one by one its array index with line breaks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
products.innerHTML += product[0]+ "<br>";
products.innerHTML += product[1]+ "<br>";
products.innerHTML += product[2]+ "<br>";
products.innerHTML += product[3]+ "<br>";
products.innerHTML += product[4];
</code></pre>
            <p>Pretty bad code right? What if we have 100-200 or thousands of indexes? </p>
            <p>That's where loops come:</p>
            <ol>

                <li><h3>While loop</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array
var product = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs",
    "books",
    "laptops"
];

//Storing the length of the array to variable
var productLength = product.length;

//Store id to variable
var products = document.getElementById('products');

//The loop comparison var we will use to our loop
var i = 0;

//While loop
while(i < productLength){
        products.innerHTML += product[i]+"<br>";
        i++;
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>So here we declared a var i = 0. Imagine it like the start for our loop.</p>
                    <p>Then we said while i value is less than our productLength at
                    products.innerHTML add the value product[0] + line break. After that give i + 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now the script goes to
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
products.innerHTML += product[i]+"<br>";
</code></pre>
                        <p>but now i is 1. After that i++ so i becomes 2 back again to</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
products.innerHTML += product[i]+"<br>";
</code></pre>
                    <p>but i now is 3 and so on.</p>
                    <p>So to finalize i becomes 0,1,2,3,4 until it reaches the array length and then the loop stops.</p>
                    <p class="alert"><strong>Remember to make i++ or i-- always else
                    it will never stop.
                    </strong></p>

                    <p>We can use a loop to take stuff from a page of course.</p>
                    <p>Let' s say we have some products in our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv class="container">
    &ltul id="pageProducts">
        &ltli> mobile-phones &lt/li>
        &ltli> air-conditions &lt/li>
        &ltli> tvs &lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
&lt/div>
</code></pre>
                    <p>In our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Where to show pageProducts
var products = document.getElementById("products");

//pageProducts in our html
var pageProducts = document.getElementById('pageProducts').getElementsByTagName("li");

//While loop with dynamically creating a list item for each product
var i = 0;
while(i < pageProducts.length){
        products.innerHTML +="&ltli>" +pageProducts[i].innerHTML+"&lt/li>";
        i++;
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>So the newly created html code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv class="container">
    &ltul id="products">
        <!--Inserted dynamically-->
        &ltli> mobile-phones &lt/li>
        &ltli> air-conditions &lt/li>
        &ltli> tvs &lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
&lt/div>
</code></pre>
                    <p>Pretty amazing right?</p>
                    <p>Let's make it even cooler with functions and parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function showProducts(takeFrom,showTo){
    //Where to show
    var products = document.getElementById(showTo);

    //What to take
    var pageProducts = document.getElementById(takeFrom).getElementsByTagName("li");

    //Loop to show them all
    var i = 0;
    while(i < pageProducts.length){
        products.innerHTML +="&ltli>" +pageProducts[i].innerHTML+"&lt/li>";
                i++;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>We simple call the function where we want and give arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
showProducts("pageProducts","products");
</code></pre>
                    <p>Yes now you are the programmer!</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Do...While loop</h3>
                <p>The do while loop works almost the same but do will run at least one time even if the while condition is false: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Loop variable
var i = 6;

//Function that takes from an id the content and shows it somewhere else
function showProducts(takeFrom,showTo){
    //Where to show
    var products = document.getElementById(showTo);

    //What to take
    var pageProducts = document.getElementById(takeFrom).getElementsByTagName("li");

    //Even while condition isn't true the code block in do will execute once
    do{
        products.innerHTML +="&ltli>" +pageProducts[0].innerHTML+"&lt/li>";
        i++;
    }
    while(i < pageProducts.length);
}

showProducts("pageProducts","products");
</code></pre>
                <p>We have given pageProduct[0] since if we put i it will return undefined because the
                pageProduct length is smaller than 6.
                </p>

                </li>


                <li><h3>For loop</h3>
                <p>Works like the while loops but with its own syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Array
var products = [
    "mobile-phones",
    "air-conditions",
    "tvs",
    "books",
    "laptops"
];

//Loop through the array index and show in our document id everything
for(var i=0; i < products.length; i++){
    document.getElementById("products").innerHTML +=  products[i]+ "<br>";
}

</code></pre>
                    <p>So we declared a var i=0 then we said if i < products.length then do i++.
                        Pretty straightforward and clean code right?</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Break and continue</h3>
                <p>We have already seen break with switch which means jumping out when condition is met.
                    Continue ignores current condition and jumps over it. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
for(var i=0; i < 5; i++){
    if(i===2){
        break;
    }
    document.getElementById("products").innerHTML += i + "<br>";
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>A simple loop which when i === 2 it jumps out the loop and stops. </p>
                    <p>If we wrote:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
for(var i=0; i < 5; i++){
    if(i===2){
        continue;
    }
    document.getElementById("products").innerHTML += i + "<br>";
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Then we will had all numbers less than 5 except 2. </p>
                    <p>Why this is useful?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
for(var i=0; i < 5; i++){
    if(i===2){
        continue;
    }
    document.getElementById("products").innerHTML += i + "<br>";
}
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><h3>For/in loop</h3>
                    <p>This loops through the properties of an object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Create an object
var client ={
    id:1,
    name:"George",
    lastName:"Tourtsinakis"
};

//Search for the properties of the objct and show them at console
for (var property in client){
    console.log(property);
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>And to access the properties values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Create an object
var client ={
    id:1,
    name:"George",
    lastName:"Tourtsinakis"
};

//Search for the properties of the objct and show them at console
for (var property in client){
    console.log(client[property]);
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>But what if you want to loop with for/in in our html document?</p>
                    <p>We have a list of items in our html like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv class="container">
    &ltul id="products">
        <!--Inserted dynamically-->
        &ltli> mobile-phones &lt/li>
        &ltli> air-conditions &lt/li>
        &ltli> tvs &lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
&lt/div>
</code></pre>
                    <p>The below code will show us HTML Object,function etc..</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("products").getElementsByTagName("li");

for (var property in products){
    //Let's see what type is each products property with typeOf
    console.log(typeOf products[property]);
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>To fix this we do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("products").getElementsByTagName("li");

for (var property in products){
    if(typeof products[property] !=="object"){
        break;
    }
    else{
        console.log (products[property].innerHTML);
    }

}
</code></pre>
                    <p>You see how useful break is since we don't need to continue if there are not objects in.</p>
                <p>We can use loops in arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function addNumbers(){
    var sum = 0;

    for(var property in arguments){
        sum += arguments[property];
    }
    return sum;

}

console.log(addNumbers(6,2));
</code></pre>
                    <p>We are adding each arguments property to sum we return sum and then give arguments
                    to the function in our console.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <p>Probably you have already heard with javascript you will be able to manipulate the DOM
             and do wonderful stuff.
            </p>
            <p>But what's the point of manipulating something if you don't know what it is?</p>
            <p>When a web page is loaded it creates a Document Object Model of the page.  </p>
            <p>It's a world standard that was created from W3C so every browser can show you html and xml content.</p>
            <p>The objects are what we have in our document from head, body, elements and they have properties, methods, events.</p>
            <p>Imagine the DOM as the tree which the document has roots and branches
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">as you can see here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>The model defines those standards. With javascript you can change anything in the DOM.</p>
            <p>That's why it is called the DOM. You have the document, objects in it and the model. So they
            named it DOM - Document Object Model.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Everything in the DOM is a node.</strong></p>
            <p>To see DOM properties, methods etc in chrome you can see them in properties tab at right when you have chosen an
            element, in mozilla with firebug or the add-on DOM inspector a tab that's called DOM.
            </p>
            <section>
            <h3>DOM properties</h3>
            <p>Let's say we have this html code so we use it with DOM properties below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltsection id="mainSection">
    &ltdiv>I am a div &lt/div>
&lt/section>
</code></pre>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>nodeName</h4>
                    <p>Name of node. Most times the tag name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Store the nodeName of id mainSection
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection").nodeName;
//It will show us SECTION
console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                </li>

                <li><h4>Attributes</h4>
                <p>The attributes property returns the node's attributes.</p>
                    <p>In our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="productsId">Item1&lt/div>
</code></pre>
                    <p>In javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("productsId").attributes[0].nodeValue;

console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                    <p>It will return productsId since this is the value of our 0 indexed attribute</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>nodeValue</h4>
                <p>It returns the value of the node but you must call the index of the attributes array which was
                created as you can see in your tools:
                </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection").attributes[0].nodeValue;

console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                    <p>It will return the id which id mainSection.</p>
                    <p>Though this is a confusing way so we better use the getAttribute method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection");

console.log(products.getAttribute("id"));
</code></pre>
                    <p>We are just saying to get the id attribute.You can find classes or any attribute.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>setAttribute</h4>
                    <p>This is more powerful since we can search the whole document and add an attribute dynamically.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection");


//Adding attribute class with value addedClass
products.setAttribute("class","addedClass");
</code></pre>
                    <p>Now check your developer tools the mainSection id that has the class addedClass.</p>

                </li>
                <li><h4>removeAttribute</h4>
                <p>This is the opposite and you remove an attribute that you don't want anymore:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Removing a class attribute
products.removeAttribute("class");
</code></pre>

                </li>

                <li><h4>parentNode</h4>
                    <p>Every node has a parent. For example the parent of body tag is html.
                        The parent of html is the document itself.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>childNodes</h4>
                    <p>The childNodes property returns a collection of a node's child nodes, which are lower in the hierarchy
                        and belong to a parent node. </p>
                </li>

                <li><h4>firstChild</h4>
                    <p>First node child.</p>
                    <p>Suppose we have in our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltul id="mainSection">
    &ltli>Item1&lt/li>
    &ltli>Item2&lt/li>
    &ltli>Item3&lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
</code></pre>
                    <p>In javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection").firstChild;

console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                    <p>You will notice that it returns #text. This because of the empty space we have.
                    If we do:
                    </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltul id="mainSection">&ltli>Item1&lt/li>
    &ltli>Item2&lt/li>
    &ltli>Item3&lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
</code></pre>
                    <p>Now you get the first child which is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltli>Item1&lt/li>
</code></pre>
                    <p>Our html code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltul id="mainSection">
    &ltli>Item1&lt/li>
    &ltli>Item2&lt/li>
    &ltli>Item3&lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
</code></pre>
                    <p>To access the text in it you should do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection").childNodes[1].firstChild.nodeValue;


console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                    <p class="alert">The above code is bad and hard to understand.
                        Don't try to access nodes like that since you and your team will get lost, even if
                        you are the best programmers.</p>
                </li>


                <li><h4>lastChild</h4>
                    <p>Last node child.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>innerHTML</h4>
                <p>We have already see it and it's a property for the content of an element. </p>
                    <p>Let's improve our above bad code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("mainSection").getElementsByTagName("li")[0].innerHTML;

console.log(products);
</code></pre>


                </li>
                <li><h4>textContent</h4>
                <p>Textcontent works like innerHTML with the disadvantage of being supported in IE>9
                and one major advantage that shows only the text we have nothing else.
                </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="products">&ltspan>I'm inside div.&lt/span>&lt/div>
</code></pre>

                <p>With innerHTML </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("products").innerHTML;
</code></pre>
                    <p>We would have &ltspan>I'm inside div.&lt/span></p>
                    <p>But with textContent we get only the content which will be:<strong> I'm inside div.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>previousSibling and nextSibling</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltul id="products">&ltli id="item1">Item1&lt/li>&ltli id="item2">Item2&lt/li>&ltli id="item3">Item3&lt/li>
&lt/ul>
</code></pre>
                    <p>And in our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.getElementById("item1").nextSibling.innerHTML;

console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                    <p>We wil get Item2.</p>
                    <p class="alert-warning">Note that I made the html code without white spaces
                    else it counts differently.
                    </p>

            <h3>DOM methods</h3>
                <ol>

                    <li><h4>getElementById() Method</h4>
                    <p>We have used it and many times until now and I hope you have
                        understand what it does. You select an element by its id.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>getElementsByTagName() Method</h4>
                    <p>Also we have used it. You select an element by tag name. Returns a node list. A node list is an array-like collection of nodes.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>getElementsByClassName() Method</h4>
                    <p>Simple and clear you select an element by class name.</p>
                    <p class="alert-warning">Not supported in IE 6,7,8 and it's not used much since it returns
                    a NodeList and doesn't behave as you wanted to all the times.
                    </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>getElementsByName() Method</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltinput name="firstName" type="text" value="George">
</code></pre>
                        <p>It will search for all elements with the attribute name and the value we want.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var firstName = document.getElementsByName("firstName");

//Will return George
console.log(firstName);
</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>querySelectorAll() Method</h4>
                        <p>A pretty strong method that returns all CSS selectors like id and classes.
                            Also it creates an array you can access by index. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltul id="mainSection">
    &ltli class="products">Item1&lt/li>
    &ltli class="products">Item2&lt/li>
    &ltli class="products">Item3&lt/li>
    &lt/ul>
</code></pre>
                        <p>Of course we can see how many items have with this class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.querySelectorAll('.products');

//Will return how many items have the class products
console.log(products.length);
</code></pre>
                        <p>It will return 3.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>querySelector() Method</h4>
                    <p>The difference with querySelectorAll() is that it returns the first selector
                    it finds and it's better to use since it doesn't create array like
                    querySelectorAll().
                    </p>
                    <p class="alert-warning">The query selectors are not supported in older
                    browsers <= IE 8.
                    </p>
                        <p>Also you can do something more advanced like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.querySelector('#mainSection li ');


console.log(products);
</code></pre>
                        <p>It will show the first list of id mainSection.</p>
                        <p><button>Show multiple choice</button></p>
                    </li>

            <h3>Manipulate CSS with javascript</h3>
                <p>We will start applying what we learned to change some styling in CSS.</p>
                <p>Our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltul id="mainSection">
    &ltli class="products">Item1&lt/li>
    &ltli class="products">Item2&lt/li>
    &ltli class="products">Item3&lt/li>
&lt/ul>
</code></pre>
                <p>In javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var products = document.querySelector('#mainSection');

products.style.backgroundColor = "#f2e6d9";

products.style.borderRadius = "25px";
</code></pre>
                <p>Style is an object and you access its properties like above.</p>
                <p>Result:</p>
                <ul id="mainSection">
                    <li id="item1" class="products">Item1</li>
                    <li id="item2" class="products">Item2</li>
                    <li id="item3" class="products">Item3</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note alert-info">Note: The style properties are exactly like CSS but they use
                    uppercase convention. The CSS would be background-color and in javascript the property
                    is backgroundColor.
                </p>
                <p><button>Show multiple choice</button></p>

                    <li><h4>createElement()</h4>
                    <p>In our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Storing the created p to a var
var p= document.createElement("p");

                        <p>But we have just created it without putting anywhere.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h4>appendChild() and removeChild()</h4>
                    <p>To have it in our html you must append it:</p>

                <li><h3><strong>this</strong> keyword</h3>
                    <p>The "this" keyword is VERY VERY important and you must get used to it.</p>
                    <p>It refers to the object or element that's owns the current code but let's see it in action.</p>

                    <p>Let's have two fixed width images in our html inside two divs :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&lt;div class="productsLayout ">
    &lt;img  class="productImg" src="assets/img/turntable.jpg" alt="Turntable">
    &lt;button class="buyMe">Buy Me&lt/button>
&lt;/div >
&lt;div class="productsLayout ">
    &lt;img  class="productImg"  src="assets/img/amplifier.png" alt="Amplifier">
    &lt;button class="buyMe">Buy Me&lt/button>
&lt;/div>
</code></pre>


                    <h3>onmouseover and onmouseout</h3>
                    <p>Your client wants when you hover a product an effect and buy button to appear.</p>
                    <p class="alert-info">Note : This can be done with CSS also using the selector hover.</p>
                    <p>In our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//Remember that querySelectorAll creates an array
var product = document.querySelectorAll(".productsLayout");

//This function changes the background color and make button to appear
function greyEffect() {
    this.style.backgroundColor = "#f2f2f2";
    this.children[1].style.display = "inline-block";
}

//Resets the products to appear normally
function normalImg(){
    this.style.backgroundColor = "white";
    this.children[1].style.display = "none";
}

//Apply in each product in hover the greyEffect in mouseout the reset
function productHoverEffect() {
    //We will access which index we want from product array to run our functions
    product[0].onmouseover = greyEffect;
    product[0].onmouseout = normalImg;
    product[1].onmouseover = greyEffect;
    product[1].onmouseout = normalImg;
}

//Start the function for effects
productHoverEffect();
</code></pre>
                    <p>Now we said : this element(in our case product[0] or product[1]) invoked the function so run your code for this element. It's like showing this, this, this.  </p>
                    <p>Remember we used "this" in constructor when we wanted to refer to "this" object.</p>
                    <p>If we didn't have this we would have to write for each element id a function or use
                    parameters and have really terrible code like that:
                    </p>
                    <p>And below the result of out code:</p>
                    <div class="container-fluid">
                        <div class="row">

                            <div class="productsLayout ">

                            </div>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Don't forget to look your developer tools for details for your front end code like html,CSS and javascrit.</p>
                    <p class="alert-danger"><strong >Bad bad bad code without this keyword</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">

                        <p>Our html code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="firstEvent" onclick="alert('red wins!')">click me &lt/div>
</code></pre>
                        <p>What we will get in our console if we have also this external javascript with defer?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var firstEvent = document.getElementById("firstEvent");

firstEvent.onclick = function(){
    console.log('blue wins!');
}

                </li>

                <li><h3>onload Event</h3>
                <p>The onload event is VERY VERY important and it says only when an object have finished
                loading trigger.
                </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
window.onload = function(){

    //Put your code here

}
</code></pre>
                    <p>With this code we are saying to run the code after the entire page has loaded(everything).
                    </p>
                    <p>So even if you remove the defer attribute from the script(since some older browsers
                        don't support it) your code will run fine after everything is loaded.</p>
                    <p>Libraries like jquery solve these issues but first you must totally understand
                    pure javascript and <strong>then</strong> move to a library or a framework.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>addEventListener and removeEventListener</h3>
                <p>The addEventListener is needed if we wanted for example to add another function
                    to run also onmouseover or onmouseout. We could have a function that
                    will run all our functions but that's not clean and descriptive code.
                </p>
                <p>Our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="canYouHearMe">Can you hear me? &lt/div >
</code></pre>

                    <p>In javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
//=====Event listener=====
var canYouHearMe = document.getElementById("canYouHearMe");

function changeText(){
    this.innerHTML = "YES I CAN HEAR YOU!";
}

function changeColor() {
    this.style.color = "darkblue";
}

function reset(){
    this.innerHTML = "Can you hear me?";
    this.style.color = "black";
}


canYouHearMe.addEventListener("mouseover",changeText);
canYouHearMe.addEventListener("mouseover",changeColor);
canYouHearMe.addEventListener("mouseout",reset);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Result:</p>
                    <div id="canYouHearMe">Can you hear me? </div >
                    <p>Pretty clean and understandable code without saying on just mouseover or mouseout.</p>

                    <p class="alert-info">If we want to get the value of a CSS property we have to do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var canYouHearMe = document.getElementById("canYouHearMe");
var  currentColor = window.getComputedStyle(canYouHearMe).getPropertyValue("color");
console.log(currentColor);
</code></pre>
                    <p>You see it returns the rgb color. You can convert RGB, hex <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">here in color picker</a>. </p>
                    <p>Now let's see how to removeEventListener:</p>
                    <p>Our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="stopChangingColor">Stop changing color&lt/div >
</code></pre>
                    <p>Javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
stopChangingColor.addEventListener("click",function () {
   canYouHearMe.removeEventListener("mouseover",changeColor) ;
});
</code></pre>
                    <button id="stopChangingColor">Stop changing color </button>
                    <p>If you press the button you will see at "Can You Hear Me" that color won't change anymore.</p>
                <p class="alert-warning">Note : IE 6 ,7 ,8 don't support addEventListener and removeEventListener.
                    You have to use attachEvent and detachEvent with on before like onclick, onmouseover etc.
                    Libraries like jquery solve this kind of problems but remember first you
                    must be comfortable with javascript and then use libraries and frameworks.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Event object created by first argument</h3>
                    <p>The first argument of the function that's assigned to an event is always an event object.
                    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp" target="_blank">Find all event objects here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>The event argument is needed only if you are gonna use it.</p>

                    <p>Out html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="coolDiv">Click the cool div to see the event object &lt/div >
</code></pre>
                    <p>Javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var coolDiv = document.getElementById("coolDiv");

//Since we have an event on coolDiv the first argument e is an event object with properties
function doSomething(event){
        coolDiv.innerHTML = event.altKey;
}

//onmousemove event for cooldDiv
coolDiv.onclick = doSomething ;
</code></pre>
                    <p>The altKey property checks if alt is pressed. So if you click the cool div without
                    having pressed alt it returns false else true.</p>
                    <p>Result:</p>
                    <div id="coolDiv">Click here the cool div to see the event object</div>

                    <p class="alert-info">Try to use some properties of the event object like button ,
                    clientX(try it with onmousemove), clientY(try it with onmousemove), keyCode, target or anything you want from the link I gave you to practice more.</p>
                    <p class="alert-warning">Note : IE <=8 you need to type window.event. Still libraries like jquery will fix those kind of problems.
                    </p>

                    <section><h4>Event target</h4>
                        <p>The target event property returns the element that triggered the event:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function doSomething(event){
    console.log(event.target.nodeName);
}
</code></pre>
                        <p>We will see at our console "div".</p>

                    </section>

                    <section><h4>Passing second argument in </h4>
                    <p>We said that the first argument is always an event object and created automatically. If you want to pass
                    extra arguments you have to do this:

                    </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
coolDiv.onclick = function(event){
   doSomething(event ,"second argument passed");

};

function doSomething(event, secondArgument){
        coolDiv.innerHTML = secondArgument;
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Now you will see second argument passed to appear when you click in your coolDiv. Try it!</p>
                    <p>We created an anonymous function for onclick event which we passed the second argument and as first argument "event".</p>
                    </section>



                    <section>
                    <h4>preventDefault()</h4>
                    <p>The preventDefault method is very common used with the event object. It prevents the default
                    behavior but let's see it in action.
                    </p>
                    <p>Suppose you have a nav bar that is created dynamically from Wordpress or your own CMS which adds ids and links:</p>

                    <nav class="navbarCustom">
                        <ul class="navList">
                            <li><a id="menuItem1" href="index.html">Home </a></li>
                            <li><a id="menuItem2" href="/">Blog </a></li>
                            <li><a id="menuItem3" href="/">Check My Work</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </nav>
                    <p>But this bar is in your blog which has an external link to your main cool portfolio site.
                    Users don't like redirection so it would be better to inform them if they need to be redirected.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function prevent(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
}

menuItem3.onclick = prevent;
</code></pre>
                    <p>You will see that nothing happens when we click our menuItem3.</p>

                        <h3>Describe event bubbling(event propagation)...</h3>
                        <p>By this terminology we mean that a user interacts with a nested element and the event propagates up (“bubbles”)
                            through all of the higher in hierarchy elements. You know that top in hierarchy is the document then html,
                            then body and inside body everything at lower levels.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sounds little confusing so let't see it in action.</p>
                        <p>Our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="bigCircle">
    &ltdiv id="medCircle">

    &lt/div>
&lt/div>
</code></pre>
                        <p>Check your developer tools for CSS and here is the result:</p>
                        <div id="bigCircle">
                            <div id="medCircle">
                                <div id="smallCircle"></div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>And javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var bigCircle = document.getElementById("bigCircle");

function increaseCircle(event,whatCircle){
    //For all browsers else for modern we can do only e = event
    var e = event || window.event;
    whatCircle = e.target || e.srcElement;
    whatCircle.style.width = "300px";
    whatCircle.style.height = "300px";
}

bigCircle.onclick = function(event){
    increaseCircle(event,this);
};
</code></pre>
                        <p>As you can see even if we have only the bigCircle's id the event works for
                        all elements inside it.
                            Also notice that we are storing event || window.event(for IE<=8) to a var.
                            Then we say our paramater wharCircle will be e.target || e.srcElement(which is
                            again used for IE<=8)
                        </p>
                        <p>But what if you had this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var bigCircle = document.getElementById("bigCircle");
var medCircle = document.getElementById("medCircle");
var smallCircle = document.getElementById("smallCircle");

                <li><h3>onscroll Event, scrollBy() and pageYOffset </h3>
                    <p>Let's create a back to top button and see where our scroll bar is:</p>
                    <p>Our html:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
&ltdiv id="backToTop">Back To Top&lt/div>
&ltdiv>Your scroll pageYOffset is: &ltspan id="pageOffSetY">&lt/span>&lt/div>
</code></pre>
                    <p>Remember to check your developer tools to see the styling!</p>


                    <div id="backToTop">Back To Top</div>
                    <div>Move slowly your scroll bar and you pageYOffset is : <span id="pageOffSetY"></span></div>
                    <p>Our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var backToTop = document.getElementById("backToTop");
var pageOffSet = document.getElementById("pageOffSetY");


backToTop.onclick = function () {
    window.scrollBy(0, -1 * window.pageYOffset)  ;
};

window.onscroll = function () {
    if(window.pageYOffset > 2000){
        backToTop.style.display = "block";
    }
    else{
        backToTop.style.display = "none";
    }

    pageOffSet.innerHTML = parseInt(window.pageYOffset);
};
</code></pre>
                    <p>We are saying when we click backToTop change scroll which the first parameter is x axis the second y axis. Try
                    to change it to a value like 100 200 or something to see what happens so you can understand. Now we are saying
                    to go to top.
                    </p>

                    <p>Then we say if window.onscroll window.pageYOffset > 2000 then backToTop display block
                    in all other cases make it disappear. You see the Back To Top div appear and it's in right corner
                        only when we are below 2000.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, show us with innerHTML the window.pageYOffset inside the ParseInt method which makes it
                    a clear integer. Yes you created something like that!

                <li><h3>Timing events - setTimeout() and setInterval()</h3>
                    <p>Timing events are events that will start based on an internal timer.</p>
                     <p>They have two parameters which the first is the function to be executed
                      and the second milliseconds.</p>
                    <p> The difference between the two is that setInterval repeats the
                    function continuously.</p>

//We call each second a function with setTimeout and make visible the counter
function timerStart(){
    counter.style.display = "block";
    setTimeout(directorThree,0);
    setTimeout(directorTwo,1000);
    setTimeout(directorOne,2000);
    setTimeout(directorAction,3000);

                    <div id="counter"></div>
                    <p>The first functions are for what we will give at each second. Then we store
                    our setTimeouts to a function that we will call by clicking startCounting. </p><p> So at 0

        <section><!--Validation forms-->
            <h2>Create a validation form</h2>
            <p>Sometimes we want to validate a form so user gives us the correct info. The most important
            thing though is to have an extra layer of protection and better user experience. Though this can be done
            with back end the best way as suggested in Stackoverflow which I totally agree is to have both front end
            and back end security measures.
            </p>
            <p>We can use the following events:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>onkeydown
                    <p>Detects what key on our keyboard is down(pressed).</p>
                </li>

                <li>onkeypress
                <p>Same as onkeydown but doesn't detect all keys like alt arrows etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>onkeyup
                <p>Detects when you the key is up(released).</p>
                </li>

                <li>onfocus
                    <p>It means when we click inside the element something will happen.</p>
                </li>

                <li>onblur
                    <p>The opposite of onfocus when you click and then leave with tab or click elsewhere.</p>
                </li>

                <li>onchange
                    <p>The onchange event happens when a value of element changes.
                        It's used more with radiobuttons and checkboxes.  </p>
                </li>

                <li>event.which
                    <p>Gets the value of the pressed keyboard key.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our form:</p>
            <form id="myForm">
                <div><label for="fullName" >Full Name:</label></div>

                <div id="formError"></div>
                <div><input type="submit" name="submitFormButton"></div>

            </form>

            <p>Our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//In a form we can get the value directly like that with name attribute
    var fullName = document.getElementById("myForm").fullName;
    var phone = document.getElementById("myForm").phone;
    var submitFormButton = document.getElementById("myForm").submitFormButton;
    var formError = document.getElementById("formError");

<pre><code class="language-javascript">fullName.onkeydown = function (event) {
    console.log(event.which);
};
</code></pre>
            <p>You can get the value of an input field directly by getting the id of the form and
            the name of the input. Next we say when a key is down at fullName show which.
            </p>
            <p><span class="alert-warning">Note : IE <=8 needs e.keyCode instead of which so we have to write
             var keyPressed = event.which || event.keyCode and use that variable accordingly.
            </span></p>

            <h4>isNaN function</h4>
            <p>With this function we can check if something is not a number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    //Function that will check if something is a number
    function isNumber(valueToCheck){
        return !isNaN(valueToCheck);//So this becomes is a number two negatives gives us positive
    }

    phone.onkeyup = function (event) {
        if(!isNumber(this.value)){
            formError.innerHTML = "Please only numbers allowed";
            formError.style.color = "red";
        }
        else{
            formError.innerHTML = "";
        }
    };
</code></pre>
       <p>But we can use the String object and call the fromCharCode method that will convert
       Unicode values to characters.
       </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    phone.onkeydown = function (event) {
        //Lets only numbers to be pressed in our phone field
        if(!isNumber(String.fromCharCode(event.which))&& event.which !== 8){//Fix for backspace
            formError.innerHTML = "Please only numbers allowed";
            formError.style.color = "red";
            event.preventDefault();

            formError.innerHTML = "";

    };
</code></pre>
            <p>With the code above we prevent the user from typing non numbers in our phone field
            and we show them error message.
            </p>
            <p>Now let's create a flag variable to check if everything is as we want then the form will be submitted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    //Flag variable
    var flag = 0;

    phone.onkeydown = function (event) {
            //Lets only numbers to be pressed in our phone field
            if(!isNumber(String.fromCharCode(event.which))&& event.which !== 8){//Fix for backspace
                flag = 0;
                formError.innerHTML = "Please only numbers allowed";
                formError.style.color = "red";
                event.preventDefault();
            }
             else{
                flag = 1;
                formError.innerHTML = "";
            }
    };

    submitFormButton.onclick = function (event) {
        if(flag===0){
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    };
</code></pre>
            <p>As you can see now the form can't be submitted but only if flag is 1
                which we change with some conditions. We can do anything we want
                check if fields are empty and change variable if they have non accepted characters and stuff like that.
            </p>
            <p>Also you can find patterns that don't accept specific characters easily in google or in my contact forms
            code in my sites.

            <h4>options and selectedIndex</h4>
            <p>Options text property is a zero indexed array and selectedIndex returns the selected array index.</p>
            <p>Chose the option to see the text changes according to it's value:</p>
            <form id="superHeroesForm">
                <select name="heroes">
                    <option value="i'm batman">Batman</option>
                    <option value="i'm superman">Superman</option>
                </select>
                <div id="showSelectedOption"></div>
            </form>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    //===========Select form================
    var superHeroesForm = document.getElementById("superHeroesForm");

    var heroes = superHeroesForm.heroes;

    var showSelectedOption = document.getElementById("showSelectedOption");

    heroes.onchange = function(){

        //showSelectedOption.innerHTML =heroes.options[0].text;
        showSelectedOption.innerHTML =heroes.options[heroes.selectedIndex].value;
        //showSelectedOption.innerHTML =this.value;
    };

            <p class="alert-info">
                <span >Try to change the value property in the above code with text.</span>
            </p>
            <p>And if you wanted to be more cool:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">showSelectedOption.innerHTML = this.value;
</code></pre>
            <h4>remove() and add()</h4>
            <p>We can remove a select option and add like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//Remove the zero indexed option
selection.remove(0);

</code></pre>

                <label><input id="addHeroField" type="text"></label>
                <button id="addHero">Add hero</button><h4>Now check above our heroes!</h4>
                <p>And our javascript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    var addHero = document.getElementById("addHero");

    addHero.onclick = function () {

    var addHeroField = document.getElementById("addHeroField").value;
        if(addHeroField) {
            var newOption = document.createElement("option");
            newOption.text = addHeroField;
            heroes.add(newOption);
        }

    };
</code></pre>



            <h3>innerHTML vs value vs text</h3>
            <p>A lot of newcomers confuse why to use this over that. Let's clear it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>innerHTML - gets the text of an HTML element</li>
                <li>value - if we have value attribute else the text for the element as the pizza example above</li>
                <li>text - used to change text inside option etc(not the value) </li>

            </ol>
