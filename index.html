        <!--Prologue-->
        <section>
            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
            <p>Javascript is the programming language of the web. When we had the first internet pages,
            everything was simple with some text inside it and some very basic styling.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, world wide web has evolved tremendously and users interact with pages in many
                ways. A pop up window, menus changing, image sliders and anything that you see in modern
                pages that increases their experience.

            </p>
            <p>Here is where javascript comes. Thanks to javascript you can manipulate the page with many amazing ways.</p>

            <h2>Do you need javascript?</h2>
            <p>Yes, yes and yes. If you are serious about web developing and not only then javascript is a must.</p>
            <p>HTML5 and CSS3 are really powerful, but for anything web related to shine you must have javascript.</p>
            <p>When you have your first application or website that does something thanks to javascript, you will say WOW!  </p>

        <!--What you need to start-->
        <section>
            <h2>What you need to start?</h2>
            <p>Some basic HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>A text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.1.html">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and a browser nothing more. So strong javascript is.</p>
            <p>After time passes though and you start to feel comfortable with the language you should use an IDE like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Webstorm</a>.</p>
            <p>Also you can use <a href="https://jsbin.com/?html,output">jsbin</a> or<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"> jsfiddle</a> which are nice tools for showing to others your code. </p>

        <!--First hello world with javascript-->
        <section>
            <h2>Let's start! Your first Hello world with javascript!</h2>
            <p>Create an html page and add these lines at head tag:</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script>
    alert("Hello world");
</script>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>This is an inline script and you can insert it anywhere in our HTML.
                Though inline scripting is not recommended.
            </p>
            <p>You should use external scripts.</p>

        </section><!--End First hello world with javascript-->

        <!--External scripts-->
        <section>
            <h2>External scripts</h2>
            <p>As the word says these are scripts we call from outside our HTML page. It's best to use external scripts since your code will become bigger
            and you maintain them more easily.
            </p>
            <p>Create a folder in your project called js. Then create a file called main.js</p>
            <p>At main.js write</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
alert("Hello world");
</textarea></code></pre>

            <p>Now we should call it!</p>
            <h3>4 ways to call it :</h3>

            <!--First way -->
            <h4>First not recommended to add these lines at head tag.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script src="js/main.js" ></script>
</textarea></code></pre>


        <p>So we are saying to our HTML to use an external script since we have the src attribute at js/main.js which is of type text/javascript.</p>
        <p>Reload the page to see that we will get our alert.</p>
        <p ><span class="alert">This way is not recommended, unless a script must start that manipulates CSS,images etc.</span>Imagine that page starts to run the code from top to bottom.
        When it finds this script the page will stop to load this script and then continue. That' s bad user experience, search engines don't like your page to be slow
            and you will see that speed measurements tools penalize you for that like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">google pagespeed insights</a>
            or <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">gtmetrix</a>.
        </p>
          <!--End First way -->


        <!--Second way -->
        <h4>Second way old school but correct and no browser problems.</h4>
        <p>Just put the external script code at the end of the body.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script src="js/main.js" ></script>
&lt;/body>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>It will load the script when everything have finished so no problems with that. If you have many scripts just put them
            below and they will run from top to bottom.
            </p>

        <!--Third way-->
            <h4>Third way async attribute.</h4>
            <p>Just put the external script code at the head of the body with async attribute.</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script async src="js/main.js" ></script>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>This is a good way that doesn't stop page loading. It loads the script asynchronous with the page. Though you might see some strange
                behaviors if you have many scripts that are depended each other.
            </p>
            <!--End Third way way -->

            <!--Forth way-->
            <h4>Forth way defer attribute.</h4>
            <p>Just put the external script code at the head of the body with defer attribute.</p>


<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
<script defer src="js/main.js" ></script>
<script defer src="js/main2.js" ></script>
</textarea></code></pre>
            <p>This is a recommended way to load the script since it won't stop the page from loading. It loads the script at the end in order.
                So we will have after the page load main.js and then main2.js.
            </p>
            <!--End forth way -->



        </section><!--End External scripts-->

        <!--Comment section-->
        <section><h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>Comments are very important for every language. I even put comments in my html code. When your projects become bigger
                and bigger you and others that use your code will get lost, if you don't have good commenting.
            </p>
            <p> I remember a professor I had that was very very strict about that. <strong>
                Always use comments, comments, comments.
            </strong>
            </p>
            <p>We have multi line commenting and single line commenting in javascript like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
//I am single line comment
/*Multi line comments
    I love coding
    Do you? */
</textarea></code></pre>


        </section><!--End Comment section-->

        <!--Statements and semicolons section-->
        <section><h2>Statements and semicolons.</h2>
            <p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are "instructions" to be "executed" by the web browser.
            </p>
            <p>For example the line we wrote was a statement.
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><textarea readonly>
alert("Hello world");
</textarea></code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>Also you might noticed semicolons at the end and it's common usage in many programming languages. Semicolons are used to separate our statements.</p>
